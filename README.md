## User: Admin staff at Monster Inc University
**Background.**

### Sprint back log
As a Uni Admin, I want to be able to:
- create a monster student, so that I can enrol them
- list all spooky workshops, so that I can inform students on workshops
- add a student to a spooky workshop, so that the workshop has students
- see a student's grade, so that I can inform them their grade

also encapsulate certain things
